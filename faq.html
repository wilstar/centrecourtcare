<h4>My court is very slippery with a lot of moss, Will this service stop that?</h4>
<p>
Yes, With a variety of chemical we do use at our disposal. After the moss has been removed and then
treated. It will be like standing on a new surface and no longer slippery. Regularly maintaining the court
will prevent it from getting to this stage again.
</p><br>
<h4>My court is about 20 years old, will the process still work on an old surface?</h4>
<p>
Yes, regardless of age of the court. If it was placed down yesterday or 20 years+, the synthetic grass can
still be treated to remove all moss, algae and bacterium that may grow in and on it.
</p><br>
<h4>With all of the rain we have had in the past few weeks, I have noticed some dirt washed onto the surface
that doesnâ€™t seem to come out when dry. Can this be fixed?</h4>
<p>
Yes. By pressure cleaning, all dirt can be removed from the surface. There are a few techniques that
can be used. Reason being, if the court is old, the fibers under extreme pressure may tear or become
crushed. So after assessing the court, the best option will be chosen to have the court rejuvenated in the
best possible way
</p><br>
<h4>  Will the tools you use damage the court in any way?</h4>
<p>
No. Tennis courts are made with very strong fibers (obviously designed to withstand anything nature can
throw at it). Also all the sand that is withheld in the court acts as a buffer between the grass and it being
damaged. It is terribly hard to cause damage on a synthetic grass surface.
</p><br>
<h4>If I chose to go ahead with your service quoted, what is the turn around time before it will be completed?</h4>
<p>
Depending on the time of the year, we can normally get started on your court within a week. And have it
completed if not on that day, by the following. We pride ourselves in efficiency and our quality of work.
