<h4>Maintenance</h4>
<p>
We recommend that your tennis court is maintained on a quarterly basis. With various environmental
conditions your court may be subject to. You will find that your court becomes a breeding ground
for bacteria. Weeds, moss and algae can quite readily grown on and in your surface. Having a regular
maintenance (which includes chemical treatment) slows down, if not stops this process from occurring.
And also keeps your court looking fantastic all year round.
<br><br>
The most important part: when a court is not being serviced, It is inevitable that moss and algae will
grow. And with this growth it becomes unsafe to play. Slipping and sliding around a tennis court is not
fun. And defeats the reason for its purpose. Injuries often occur in the industry. Even when courts are
being serviced. We pride ourselves with safe care and precautions to stop this. You should as well in
having your court treated today!
</p><br>
<h4>Full Chemical Rejuvenation</h4>
<p>
Can involve a few of many processes to get your court back to an ‘as new’ like state again. The main
process involves scraping the entire surface of moss and algae down. To then chemically treat the
surface with an even dose of chemical. Therefore killing all the moss, algae and other bacterium which
can be found in and on the surface of your court. Obviously over time the fibers of your tennis surface
wear down. But after this treatment is completed, the courts grass will be in the condition of that of a
brand new surface.
</p><br>
<h4>Pressure Cleaning</h4>
<p>
From pressure cleaning patches, to entire courts. Centre Court Care can remove dirty area’s of your
court and bring it back to life looking new again.
</p><br>
<h4>Repairs</h4>
<p>
There is always something that can be done. Repairs of your synthetic grass can vary from a minor tear
on the surface. To whole partitions of the court lifting up due to a number of reasons.
